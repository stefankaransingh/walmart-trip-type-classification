# Walmart Trip Type Classification

Categorizing shopping trip types based on the items that customers purchased. To give a few hypothetical examples of trip types: a customer may make a small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, a trip to buy gifts for an upcoming holiday, or a seasonal trip to buy clothes


Walmart has categorized the trips contained in this data into 38 distinct types using a proprietary method applied to an extended set of data. The challenge is to recreate this categorization/clustering with a more limited set of features. This could provide new and more robust ways to categorize trips.
